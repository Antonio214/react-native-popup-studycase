# react-native-popup-studycase

This repository contains a case study on popups in React Native. The goal of this case study is to explore the different ways in which popups can be implemented in a React Native application, and to identify best practices for creating scalable and maintainable popups.

## Getting Started

To get started with the case study, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js][1]
- [Expo CLI][2]
- [Yarn][3]

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Antonio214/react-native-popup-studycase.git
```

Next, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies by running the following commands:

```bash
cd react-native-popups-case-study
yarn install
```

Finally, you can start the development server and run the case study by running the following command:

```
expo start
```

This will start the development server and open a browser window with a QR code. You can then use the Expo app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and run the case study.

## Article

In addition to the case study, this repository also contains an article on popups in React Native. The article covers the different features of popups and discusses how to implement them in a way that is efficient and adaptable. By the end of the article, you will have a good understanding of how to create and manage popups in your own React Native projects.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or improvements for the case study or the article, you can create a new issue or pull request in this repository. We welcome all contributions and are always looking for ways to make the case study and article more useful and informative.
